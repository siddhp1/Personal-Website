# Personal Website

A personal portfolio website to showcase my favourite projects and work experience. The frontend of this website is built with Next.js and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and hosted on Vercel. Media files are served by Azure Blob Storage. Continuous integration and deployment managed by GitHub Actions.
